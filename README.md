# Better-Coordinates

This mod allows you to toggle the "Show Coordinates" world option using the
input `key.show_coordinates`.

## Rationale

I hate how the coordinates just _stays_ there... it's like how the LED of the
Caps Lock key shines brightly when you press it, so you have to press it again
to untoggle the light, but that gives the opposite intended effect by making you
type in majuscule... so you gotta do some maneuvering....

## Problems

This _likely_ only works for the owner of the world.
