# Better-Coordinates

This mod allows you to toggle the "Show Coordinates" world option using the
input `key.show_coordinates` (defaults to F3).

## Rationale

I hate how the coordinates just _stays_ there... it's like how the LED of the
Caps Lock key shines brightly when you press it, so you have to press it again
to untoggle the light, but that gives the opposite intended effect by making you
type in majuscule... so you gotta do some maneuvering....

## Problems

I haven't tested this in multiplayer....

This doesn't save the key assigned to `key.show_coordinates`, so if you
reassign it, and reload the game, it will revert back to F3.
